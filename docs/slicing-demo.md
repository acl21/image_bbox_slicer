## Create And Configure `Slicer` Object
_Note: This usage demo can be found in `Slicing_Demo.ipynb` in the project's [repo](https://github.com/acl21/image_bbox_slicer)._

### Setting Paths To Source And Destination Directories
You must configure paths to source and destination directories like the following. By default it takes the current working directory as the source folder for both images and annotations and also creates new folders:

* `/sliced_images` and 
* `/sliced_annotation` 

in the current working directory.

```python
import image_bbox_slicer as ibs

im_src = './src/images'
an_src = './src/annotations'
im_dst = './dst/images'
an_dst = './dst/annotations'

slicer = ibs.Slicer()
slicer.config_dirs(img_src=im_src, ann_src=an_src, 
                   img_dst=im_dst, ann_dst=an_dst)
```

### Partial Labels

The above images show the difference in slicing with and without partial labels. In the image on the left, all the box annotations masked in <span style="color:green">**green**</span> are called Partial Labels. 

Configure your slicer to either ignore or consider them by setting `Slicer` object's `keep_partial_labels` instance variable to `True` or `False` respectively. By default it is set to `False`.

```python
slicer.keep_partial_labels = True
```

### Empty Tiles
![empty](img/empty_tiles.png)

An empty tile is a tile with no "labels" in it. The definition of "labels" here is tightly coupled with the user's preference of partial labels. If you choose to keep the partial labels (i.e. `keep_partial_labels = True`), a tile with a partial label is not treated as empty. If you choose to not keep the partial labels (i.e. `keep_partial_labels = False`), a tile with one or more partial labels is considered empty. 

Configure your slicer to either ignore or consider empty tiles by setting `Slicer` object's `ignore_empty_tiles` instance variable to `True` or `False` respectively. By default it is set to `True`.

```python
slicer.ignore_empty_tiles = False
```

### Before-After Mapping

You can choose to store the mapping between file names of the images before and after slicing by setting the `Slicer` object's `save_before_after_map` instance variable to `True`. By default it is set to `False`.

Typically, `mapper.csv` looks like the following:
```
| old_name   | new_names                       |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| 2102       | 000001, 000002, 000003, 000004  |
| 3931       | 000005, 000005, 000007, 000008  |
| test_image | 000009, 000010, 000011, 000012  |
| ...        | ...                             |
```


```python
slicer.save_before_after_map = True
```

### Slicing both images and box annotations at the same time.

** By Number Of Tiles ** 


```python
slicer.slice_by_number(number_tiles=4)
slicer.visualize_random()
```

![output-1](img/output_10_1.png)
![output-2](img/output_10_2.png)

** By Specific Size ** 


```python
slicer.slice_by_size(tile_size=(418,279), tile_overlap=0)
slicer.visualize_random()
```

![output-3](img/output_12_1.png)
![output-4](img/output_12_2.png)

*Note: `visualize_sliced_random()` randomly picks a recently sliced image from the directory for plotting.*
